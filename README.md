**MT Inventory Weight** introduces a realistic weight system to Minecraft, enhancing your gameplay by simulating the impact of carried items on movement. The mod dynamically adjusts based on your inventory's weight, meaning heavier loads affect your movement and actions.

Designed for players seeking a deeper, more strategic survival experience, this mod encourages careful item management, making each decision about what to carry significant.
