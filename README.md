## **What is MT Inventory Weight?**

**MT Inventory Weight** introduces a realistic weight system to Minecraft, enhancing your gameplay by simulating the impact of carried items on movement. The mod dynamically adjusts based on your inventory's weight, meaning heavier loads affect your movement and actions.

Designed for players seeking a deeper, more strategic survival experience, this mod encourages careful item management, making each decision about what to carry significant.

## **Why Use This Mod?**

Vanilla Minecraft allows you to carry hundreds of items without any impact on your gameplay. With **MT Inventory Weight**, you can:

- **Add Realism**: Experience how item weight affects your character, adding immersion and depth to survival and RPG-like experiences.
- **Enhance Strategy**: Stop mindlessly hoarding items. Think about what you carry and how it impacts your mobility.

- **Modular Configuration**: Configure item and armor weights to customize your gameplay.

## **Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Inventory Weight Calculation**: The mod calculates your total inventory weight based on items and armor, impacting your movement and speed.
  
- **Overload Effects**: Exceeding your maximum weight results in penalties such as reduced movement speed, slower attack speed, and possible stamina loss (configurable).
  
- **Armor Weight Impact**: Armor sets have different weight values that affect how much you can carry comfortably.
  
- **Pockets & Storage**: Some armor pieces come with pockets, letting you carry more items without penalties.

- **Customizable Weights**: Adjust item weights through mod settings to fit your gameplay style, making the experience more challenging or easier as you prefer.
