# **Custom Tooltips**

In the **MT Inventory Weight** mod, nearly all items in the game come with custom tooltips that provide additional information about the item's weight and any special attributes, such as the number of pockets for armor pieces. These tooltips are an essential feature for players, helping them understand the weight mechanics and how different items affect their overall inventory capacity.

## **Tooltip Information**

For most items, the tooltips will display the following information:

- **Item Weight**: The tooltip will show the weight of the item in the player's inventory, helping the player to manage their load effectively.
- **Armor Pockets**: If the item is a piece of armor or has pockets, additional information will appear detailing how many pockets are available on that armor piece.

### **Item Weight**

The tooltip for an item's weight appears in **gray text** and will look something like:

`Weight: 3.5`

The weight displayed depends on whether the item has a **custom weight** (a predefined weight for specific items) or a **default weight** based on its category, such as blocks, ingots, bottles, etc.

- **Custom Weights**: Certain items, such as weapons or tools, may have custom weights, which are shown directly in the tooltip.
- **Default Weights**: Items without a specific custom weight will show a default weight based on their item category.

For example:
- **Diamond Sword** might have a tooltip that displays a weight of 2.5 units.
- **Oak Planks** might have a standard weight of 1.0 units.

### **Armor and Pockets**

For armor pieces, tooltips may also provide information about the **number of pockets** the armor has. This information is shown in **blue text**, making it easy to distinguish from the item weight.

Example of an armor tooltip:

`+3 Pockets`

Pockets are important because they affect how much additional weight a player can carry by distributing it across the armor, depending on the number of pockets. For more details about pockets, please refer to the [Pockets Documentation](pockets.md).

## **Usage Scenarios**

1. **Managing Inventory Weight**: Players can use the tooltips to plan what items to carry in their inventory, prioritizing lighter or more important items.
2. **Armor and Pockets**: Players can evaluate how their armor contributes to carrying capacity by checking how many pockets are available on each armor piece.
3. **Custom Items**: Modded or custom items in the game may have unique weights defined, helping players understand their impact on inventory weight.
