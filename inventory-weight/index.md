# **MT Inventory Weight Documentation**

## **What is MT Inventory Weight?**

The **MT Inventory Weight** introduces a realistic weight system to Minecraft, adding depth and challenge to your gameplay by simulating the impact of carried items on movement. It dynamically adjusts based on the weight of items in your inventory, meaning that the heavier your load, the more it affects your movement and actions.

Designed for players who want a more immersive and strategic survival experience, this mod encourages careful management of items, making each decision about what to carry meaningful.

## **Why Use This Mod?**

In vanilla Minecraft, you can carry hundreds of items without feeling any different. With **MT Inventory Weight**, you can:

- **Add Realism**: Experience how item weight would actually impact your character. This mod adds realism and immersion, especially for survival and RPG-like experiences.
- **Enhance Strategy**: You can no longer mindlessly hoard items. You'll need to think about what you carry and how it affects your mobility.
- **Increase Difficulty**: For players who want a greater challenge, managing your inventory weight will add another layer of difficulty to Minecraft, especially in tough survival or hardcore modes.
- **Modular Configuration**: The mod allows you to configure weights for items and armor, allowing for flexible and customizable gameplay experiences.

## **Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Inventory Weight Calculation**: Your total inventory weight is dynamically calculated based on the items and armor you carry, and this directly impacts your movement and speed.
  
- **Overload Effects**: Carrying more than your maximum weight will impose penalties, such as reduced movement speed, slower attack speed, and potential stamina loss (configurable).
  
- **Armor Weight Impact**: Different armor sets will have varying weight values, affecting how much you can carry comfortably.
  
- **Pockets & Storage**: Some armor pieces include pockets, allowing you to carry more items without suffering penalties.

- **Customizable Weights**: Configure the weight of items through the mod's settings to fit your specific gameplay style. You can adjust the difficulty by changing the weights of certain items, such as tools, food, and resources.

- **Multiplayer Compatibility**: The mod works seamlessly in multiplayer, so you can enjoy the weight mechanics in both single-player and multiplayer survival sessions.

## **How This Mod Enhances Your Gameplay:**

1. **Survival Strategy**: Adds a deeper survival strategy layer, where you have to balance carrying essential tools, food, and materials versus the penalties of carrying too much weight.
   
2. **Balanced Exploration**: Encourages players to plan better before heading out on long journeys or mining expeditions, balancing risk and reward.
